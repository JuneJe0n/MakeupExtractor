#  Fine-tuning VLMs via GRPO for Automatic Makeup Extraction
üåé **This is a project done during my internship at [B*Factory](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bfactory-ai/posts/?feedView=all) | Jun 2025 - Aug 2025**<br>
üìç Special thanks to senior developers **Adri√† Arrufat** and **Saad Imran** for their support and guidance throughout this project. <br>

This project aims to automatically extract makeup looks from company photoshoots and allow customers to easily try them on their own faces using LViton‚Äôs virtual try-on system.<br>( Note: The LViton codes and implementation details are proprietary and kept private. This repository only contains the research and training code for the makeup extraction component.) <br>

The core idea is to fine-tune a Vision-Language Model (VLM) via [GRPO (Generative Reinforcement Policy Optimization)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300) to predict makeup attributes (lip, blush, eyeshadow colors) of a makeup picture in a structured JSON format.  e.g.: 
```
[
  {"shape": "LIP_FULL_BASIC", "color": "#DC3813"},
  {"shape": "BLUSHER_CENTER_WIDE_BASIC", "color": "#F07749"},
  {"shape": "EYESHADOW_OVEREYE_FULL_BASIC", "color": "#511515"}
]
```
<br>

Since a complete makeup look involves many parameters, the training was conducted progressively: <br>
Starting with **lips only** (simpler) ‚û°Ô∏è and later extending to **lips, blush, and eyeshadow.** <br><br>



## ‚öôÔ∏è Experimental Settings
### Data
- Dataset size: 10K
- Paired dataset of company's internal makeup parameters  + [FFHQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset)
### Base Model
- [Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct)
### Reward
- Self defined. Detailed description below <br><br>
